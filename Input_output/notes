FUNCTIONALITY
1. Extract full Virtual Page Number (VPN)
    Search Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) for VPN->Physical Frame Number (PFN)
    IF MISS Search page tree

2. IF VPN->PFN in TLB, use found PFN for Translation

3. IF VPN->PFN NOT in TLB, walk the page table tree
    IF in page table, insert mapping to TLB Cache
        IF TLB full, apply cache replacement using Least Recently Used (LRU) policy
    IF NOT in page table, insert page to page table tree with assigned frame index (index starts at 0 and continues sequentially) inserted page simulates demand paging allocation of a physical frame to virtual page brought into memory
    ASSUME INFINITE NUMBER OF FRAMES, NO PAGE REPLACEMENT
        after demanding page bring in page and inserts VPN->PFN mapping to table
            insert mapping to TLB cache
                IF TLB full, apply cache replacement

4. FOR BOTH CASE 2 & 3, update or insert recently accessed pages into TLB

5. IF mapping in TLB cache, increment cache hit counter
    IF NOT in TLB cache aka MISS BUT in table tree, increment page table hit counter

6. TLB cache hits + page table hits + page table misses = total # of address    accesses

7. Print appropriate outputs to the standard output as specified in "User Interface"
